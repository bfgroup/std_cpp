= Intriduction

This proposes the addition of an interface for transforming C++ source into
usable binary images. As such it aims to provide a common definition of
existing compiler frontend tool options for generating programs and libraries
for translation units.

== Motivation

This proposal is based on the notion that it should be possible for C++
user, both beginner and advanced, to easily transform their source to
immediately executable form.

One key aspect of this proposal is to make it possible for future C++
educators to provide complete usage examples that work for any particular
tool they and their students use.
